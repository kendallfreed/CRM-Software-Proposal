# Rubric for Software Proposal

A.  Using the “Quality Assurance Test Plan” supporting document, provide an overview by doing the following:

  1.  Summarize the proposed software design plan from Task 1, including identification of the problem statement being addressed from the attached “Background Information” (i.e., scenario, ticket).

2.  Identify the overall objective of the functional requirements to be tested during the quality assurance process, aligning the objective with the summarized software design plan in part A1.

a.  Summarize the quality metrics associated with the overall objective of the functional requirements, including an explanation of why the identified metrics are relevant to the software design solution.

3.  Identify the overall objective of the non-functional requirements to be tested during the quality assurance process, aligning the objective with the summarized software design plan in part A1.

a.  Summarize the quality metrics associated with the overall objective of the non-functional requirements, including an explanation of why the identified metrics are relevant to the software design solution.


B.  Using the “Quality Assurance Test Plan” supporting document, identify the project scope by doing the following:

1.  Identify two in-scope requirements to be tested within the quality assurance process that are aligned with the overall objective of the functional requirements identified in part A2.

2.  Identify two in-scope requirements to be tested within the quality assurance process that are aligned with the overall objective of the non-functional requirements identified in part A3.

3.  Identify two out-of-scope functionalities that will not be tested within the quality assurance process.

a.  For each identified functionality, explain the following points:

•   how the functionality aligns with the business requirement identified in part A1

•   why the functionality should be labeled as out of scope


C.  Using the “Quality Assurance Test Plan” supporting document, outline the testing strategy by doing the following:

1.  Provide an overview of the testing process for each in-scope requirement identified in parts B1 and B2 by filling out the “Test Case Table” with the following information:

•   Test Type: categorize by test type (e.g., unit, integration, system, end-to-end)

•   Description of Test: summarize the testing technique(s) used to validate the in-scope requirement, including sample inputs and expected results

•   Objective: restate the associated overall objective, identified in part A2 or A3, met by the in-scope requirement

•   Test Owner: identify which stakeholder role will perform the test

•   Environment: identify the testing environment or tools required for the test

2.  Define a logical sequence of testing for the testing process for each in-scope requirement provided in part C1, including the justification of the planned sequence of testing.
