# Rubric for Software Proposal
## Scenario
You are the project lead of a software development team for a project at MJ Logistics Gaming Company. The team includes business analysts, solution analysts, developers, quality assurance professionals, and a project manager, among other team members. You have been tasked with presenting a solution proposal and design and test plan with the help of your team to support the software development process. MJ Logistics Gaming also wants your team to implement a web-based customer relationship management (CRM) system for the sales force of a medium-sized company. MJ Logistics Gaming has provided a high-level requirements document to aid you in identifying an appropriate solution and gaining an overall understanding of the system the company is looking for. (See the attached “CRM Requirements.”)

## Requirements

A.  Introduce your proposed system, as outlined in the attached “Design Template.” Your introduction must address the following requirements:

1.  Provide an introduction, including an explanation of the purpose of the proposed system.

2.  Describe the problems the company is currently facing and how the proposed solution will solve those problems.

3.  Provide the goals and objectives for the project and solution.

4.  Provide a list of prerequisites that include descriptions and future completion dates.

5.  List the scope of the proposed system, including what will and will not be covered.

6.  Describe the front-end and back-end environments that the solution will be deployed in.

 

Note: The introduction section of your report may be done after the project task is completed.

 

B.  Explain how your software solution addresses four distinct requirements from the attached “CRM Requirements.” Align each of the four distinct requirements to one of the following subsections:

•   business requirements

•   user requirements

•   functional requirements

•   non-functional requirements

 

C.  Discuss the Agile method by doing the following:

1.  Compare at least three advantages and at least three disadvantages of the Agile method to those of another development method of your choice.

2.  Evaluate whether the Agile method or the development method you chose in part C1 is better suited to the solution for MJ Logistics Gaming Company, including specific examples to justify your evaluation.

 

D.  Create two different representations of your software solution (e.g., storyboard, flowchart, UML diagram, ERD) that illustrate how the system process or workflow aligns with and supports the business process for MJ Logistics Gaming Company. Include a brief description for each representation.

 

E.  Create a test plan with test cases for three different functional aspects of your software solution, including each of the following:

•   requirement to be tested

•   preconditions for each test case

•   steps for each test case

•   expected results for each test case

•   an explanation of why each test passed or failed
